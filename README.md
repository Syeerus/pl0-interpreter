## PL/0 Interpreter

This repo is an experimental venture into interpreter building that revolves
around an extended version of the [PL/0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/0)
language. It is hand written for learning purposes.

### Features
 - Case-insensitive keywords
 - Integer, float, and string data types
 - Dynamic typing
 - C style typecasting
 - Integer literals can be hexadecimal, binary, or octal numbers ("0x", "0b", and "0" prefixes)

Coding conventions used are listed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions).
